		<h2>Howdy there! I'm Kai.</h2>
		<br>
		<p>I'm a full-stack developer, designer, and technical generalist based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I serve as CDO of <a href="https://lyradevelopment.com" target="_blank">Lyra Development</a>, directing a development team in creating custom web and mobile software solutions for a broad spectrum of clients.</p>
		<p>I come from a background of diverse interests and skills and have, at different times, mastered or experimented with graphic design, technical and promotional writing, systems administration, world history, botany, stained glass, engineering, aviation, and the Oxford comma.</p>
		<p>When I'm not busy creating or learning new things, you can find me planting trees that I've grown from seed, hiking, flying paragliders, and exploring the wilderness of the American West.</p>
